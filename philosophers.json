His most famous statement, 'Cogito, ergo sum' (I think, therefore I am), encapsulates his argument for the certainty of self-existence. Descartes' major works include 'Meditations on First Philosophy,' 'Discourse on the Method,' and 'Principles of Philosophy.' His philosophy emphasizes the use of reason as the foundation for knowledge and scientific inquiry.",
